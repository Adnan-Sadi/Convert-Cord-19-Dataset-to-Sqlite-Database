# Convert-Cord-19-Dataset-to-Sqlite-Database

The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a freely available dataset containing over 1,000,000 scholarly articles (including over 400,000 with full text) about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. As quoted in the dataset's [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10706) - "CORD-19 is designed to facilitate the development of text mining and information retrieval systems over its rich collection of metadata and structured full-text papers." The dataset can be downloaded directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

The full-text scholarly articles are stored as JSON files in the CORD-19 dataset. It can often become troublesome to analyze and retrieve information about papers that are stored in JSON format. Thus, this repository contains codes that can used to convert the full-text JSON formatted papers from the Cord-19 dataset into a Sqlite3 database in Python.
